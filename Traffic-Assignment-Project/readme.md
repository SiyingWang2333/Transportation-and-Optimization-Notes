# Traffic Assignment Project

Since user equilibrium and system optimum have been introduced, this folder mainly concerns about the exact line search algorithm for solving user equilibrium.  

Besides , a course project in *Network Optimization and Modelling* lectured by Dr. Wang Xiaolei and a paper prospoed Dr. Wang will be showed. [A Convex Programming Approach for Ridesharing User Equilibrium Under Fixed Driver/Rider Demand](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3589442).
