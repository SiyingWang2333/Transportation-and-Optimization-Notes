[A Convex Programming Approach for Ridesharing User Equilibrium Under Fixed Driver/Rider Demand](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3589442)

Since listening to Dr. Wang's explanation to this paper for serval times, I took a note for this paper.

### Introduction

**Target**: As the development of ridesharing, which is a useful tool for congestion mitigation, the ridesharing user equilibrium(RUE) will be a important issue.

**Difference**: Existing papers mainly focused on RUE with lots of restrictions.

**What have done**: Assuming that all drivers travel with at most one RS rider, and each RS rider is served by only one driver, we redefine the set of driver trajectories with no restriction on feasible driver-rider matchings, and introduce market clearing conditions to characterize driversâ€™ net income from ridesharing services at market equilibrium. 

**Algorithm**: dual subgradient algorithm 

### Convex Optimization

In this paper, a convex programming approach for ridesharing user equilibrium is proposed.
